Introduction
-------------												
	Welcome to Paint Street Fighter, a 2D two player combat game developed in Turing. In this game, your objective is to knock out your opponent by reducing their health points to zero. You must stay both offensive and defensive to win with the use of damaging attacks and evasive maneuvers.

--------------
Health Points
--------------
	Each player starts with 3 sets of 30 health points. Whenever a player is damaged, their health points are depleted by either 3 or 6 points, depending on what attack was used against them. When 30 health points have been depleted, the player moves onto their next set of 30 health points, and so on until their health points have been completely depleted. Each set of health points is represented by a health bar; the first set is a green bar, the second set is an orange bar, and the last set is a red bar. Once a player has no more health points, they are knocked out and the other player wins.

Combat
-------
	Fighting is essential in Paint Street Fighter, after all it is a fighting game. There are two attacks that both players can perform: punch and kick. Although both are melee attacks, they are completely different and have their own advantages and disadvantages. Punches are quick yet short range attacks that are relatively weaker than kicks (inflict 3 points of damage). Kicks are slow yet long range attacks that inflict double the damage of punches (inflict 6 points of damage). Mix both attacks consecutively to deal devastating amounts of damage within a brief period of time.

---------
Movement
---------
	To avoid attacks in Paint Street Fighter, it is crucial to use your player’s swift movements to your advantage. Each player can dodge attacks by jumping and moving around while in the air. There is no blocking in this game, so you’ll have to rely heavily on vertical movement, not just horizontal. You cannot double jump or damage the other player by jumping onto them. Players can also punch and kick while in the air, enabling air-borne combat and aerial KO's.

Additional Information
-----------------------
	This game was created by Alex Lipianu in Mrs. Duchenne’s grade 10 Computer Engineering course of the 2014/2015 school year. As of 6/4/2015, this is the first program I have ever made, with no programming experience prior to this. I very much enjoyed working on Paint Street Fighter, familiarizing myself with the Turing programming language, and learning various programming concepts. This game has been revisited, revised, and optimized since the submission date. If you have any questions, concerns, or requests, please feel free to contact me at alexlipianu@live.ca. You can also view the rest of my projects at https://github.com/alipianu.
